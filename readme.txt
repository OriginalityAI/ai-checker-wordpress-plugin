= The Most Accurate AI Checker in the World =
The Originality.ai plugin brings the world’s most accurate AI content detector directly into your WordPress dashboard. Scan all your content – from a single post, to your entire website – for AI content.

Originality.ai is effective on AI text generated using popular large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, GPT-4, Claude, Llama, Gemini and more. It also detects paraphrase plagiarism, which is one of the most popular ways to bypass AI or plagiarism detection.

**The Originality.ai plugin brings up to 3 different AI detection models to suit your needs:**

* Lite – 98% accurate, with less than 1% false positive rate and allows for light AI editing (with tools like grammarly). Best for academia and other uses that require a low false positive rate.
* Turbo – 99%+ accurate, with less than 3% false positive rate. This model is robust against all common bypass methods and does not allow for AI editing. Best for anyone with a NO AI policy.
* Multi-language – Advanced AI detection across 15 languages.

Please be sure to watch our [tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv2aM3LvdQDL5uVH8qdhtxw) for more information on how to use the tool and properly interpret the scores.

[Pro Plans vs Enterprise Plans](https://originality.ai/pricing)

== Getting Started ==

To use the Originality.ai WordPress plugin, you will be required to create an Originality.ai account first. You can download the plugin without one, but it will be linked to your Originality.ai account and won’t run scans until you have credits added.

To set up an account with us, visit our [**sign up page here**](https://app.originality.ai/signup).

If you already have an Originality.ai account, then you’ll be prompted to login after the WordPress plugin is installed on your site. Once connected, you can start scanning your content!

Installation Instructions
To install from the WordPress search directory, go to the **Add plugin page** and search for “Originality.ai.” Next, click “Install now” to install the plugin. After installation, go to “Installed plugins” and click “Activate” to activate the Originality.ai plugin.

Once you’ve installed the plugin, you’ll be prompted to sign in to your Originality.ai account. After you’ve signed in, that’s it! You can start scanning your content.

== Usage ==

After installing the plugin, visit Settings > Originality.ai > click the settings tab. To get started, connect your Originality.ai account to the plugin by entering your login details and choose your default AI detection model. Save your settings and now you are ready to run your first scan.

On your “Posts” page, you’ll see a new column added named “Originality.ai Score”. Under this column, you’ll be able to view all of your most recent AI scores.

To scan an individual post, you have two options:

1. Click “Start new scan” under the “Originality.ai Score” column for a specific post to scan that individual page.
2. Or you can select a post > go into the WordPress editor > select “Click to Scan” in the right block under “Originality.ai Score” to scan that page.

In the WordPress editor, you can also select your Originality.ai Model. We offer 3 models: Turbo, Lite, and Multilanguage. Select which model you prefer prior to running a scan. If you want to run multiple scans under different models, you can change the model under the dropdown and scan again. For more information about our models, read our [detailed description here](https://originality.ai/blog/which-ai-detection-model-to-use).

Alternatively, if you prefer to scan multiple pages at once and save time, you can also use the “**Start AI scan for all posts**” to scan your entire website in one go.

After you’ve run your scans, you can view the scan directly in-app, which also allows you to scan for other features as well, such as plagiarism detection, fact-checking, and grammar and spelling. You can also securely share your scan with anyone by selecting “Copy link of results”.

The result of the scan will show you the confidence score of whether that post is likely AI or Original.

You can view all lifetime scan results on the Originality.ai settings page, share the results with your clients or writers, and even dig deeper into each scan in the originality.ai page.

== Why is our model more accurate? ==
Below are a few of the main reasons we suspect Originality.ai’s AI detection performance and overall AI detector accuracy are significantly better than alternatives…

1. **Larger Model:** We suspect (can’t confirm) that we use a much larger model… there is no way we could offer a free or ad supported option given our models' compute cost per scan.
‍
2. **Focus on Content Writers:** The datasets we have constructed focus on a main use case (content that is published online), and we are not a generalist AI detector. This means our detector is trained exclusively on online publications like blog posts, articles, and website copy, which means it can more accurately discern differences between human and AI-generated content in these types of writing. Our model does not get trained on classic literature which is not reflective of modern writing.
‍‍
3. **Train on Harder Datasets:** The datasets we continue to create and train our AI on focuses on increasingly adversarial detection bypassing methods. The better our AI gets the more clever the prompt engineering or playground settings need to be to bypass us and then we train on that new more challenging dataset.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I See Previous Scans? =
Yes, all scans are stored for later retrieval or sharing. Complete removal of your account and data is available upon request.

= Can Originality.ai Detect ChatGPT Content? =
Yes, Originality.ai can detect ChatGPT content.

= Can Google Detect and Penalize AI Generated Content? =
We completed a correlation study of 20,000 web pages and identified a small correlation between Originality score and Google search result ranking. Potentially indicating that AI content performs worse in Google than Original content.

= Does the WordPress Plugin Have Plagiarism Checking? =
The current version of the Originality.ai WordPress plugin does not have additional features, such as plagiarism checking, fact-checking, or grammar and spelling. However, these features can all be accessed and run on your scans through the app. Simply click on “View Scan” and you’ll be directed to the app scan page, where you can run additional features on your current scans.

= How Does AI Detection Work? =
Our internally built artificial intelligence uses supervised learning with multiple models including a modified BERT model to predict if content is AI or Original. Our AI has been provided with millions of records both AI and Original content then trained to tell the difference between the two. After each training session a large test data set is used to evaluate if the new model is an improvement or not.

= Does Originality.ai Provide Paraphrase Detection? =
Yes, Originality.ai’s AI is the only available AI that has been trained to detect if content has been paraphrased with a tool like Quillbot. If a piece of text, regardless of whether it started as AI or Human, is run through a paraphrasing tool like Quillbot Originality.ai will identify the content as AI generated 95% of the time.

= What Languages Does the AI Detector Work For? =
Originality.ai’s AI detection is currently only trained and tested against the English language. Plagiarism checking works across multiple languages. 

= Do you Have a Plagiarism Checking and AI Detection API? =
Yes, we have a robust API and have integrated it into the content operations platforms for some of the largest publishers / writing agencies and marketplaces in the world. Full documentation is in the backend. If you have a unique use case or are wondering about capabilities to handle your volume please reach out and we will be happy to discuss your needs.

= What Do AI Detection Scores Mean? =
AI detection scores are a prediction on the chance that the text submitted was AI generated or Original. They are not a measure on the amount of AI vs amount of Original content in a given text. 

We recommend not applying a similar “hard” rule when it comes to working with AI scores and writers. If a writer consistently has high Originality scores but then on one article has a higher AI score, this could very likely be a false positive and further investigation should occur. 

[‍Here](https://originality.ai/blog/ai-detection-score-meaning) is our guidance on how to interpret the AI scores for writers.

= What Can Cause False Positives? =
False positives in AI detection do occur and we are sorry if Originality.ai identified your content as AI. It is different for every tool and a specific reason on what the AI identified as causing it to predict the con

Here are 7 tips for minimizing false positives…

* A detection score of 60% Original and 40% AI is not a false positive. It correctly predicted with 60% confidence that your content was Original. The meaning of the score is not that 60% was Original and 40% was AI it means it is 60% confident the content is Original.
* Editing AI-written content is not a false positive - it is a true positive
* Having AI edit your work is not a false positive - it is a true positive
* When any amount of AI touches the content it can cause the entire article to be flagged as AI
* “Cyborg” writing where a lot of AI tools are used to create an outline, suggest edits, optimize the content can increase the chance of a higher AI score. (For this reason we created a free content optimizer tool similar to SurferSEO or MarketMuse but 100% free that does not use AI to reduce the chance of a false positive occurring.)
* Strange formatting can reduce the accuracy of the detector tools causing an increase in false positives or false negatives. 
* The shorter the text the less accurate the detection score. We recommend at least 100 words being checked. 

= How Does Originality.ai Compare to Other AI Content Detectors? =
Originality.ai is the most accurate AI content detector producing the fewest false positives while also the only tool that accurately identifies a piece of content (human or AI) that has been paraphrased. 

See the complete study analyzing how Originality.ai matches up in detection capabilities to other AI detectors here - [See Case Study](https://originality.ai/ai-content-detection-accuracy).

= How Accurate is Originality.ai AI Content Detection Tool? =
When we tested Originality.ai on the latest models released by OpenAI, Originality.ai Lite demonstrated up to 99%+ accuracy.

= What is AI Generated Text? =
AI-generated text is words that have been written by Artificial Intelligence (AI) specifically using Large Language Models (LLMs). The most common example is OpenAI’s ChatGPT which is an AI using OpenAI’s NLP Models (GPT-3, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) to understand a users prompt and provide a written response.

For the purposes of AI text detection we aim to flag any content that has been meaningfully changed by AI. We try and take an approach consistent when defining what is Plagiarism “Presenting work or ideas from another source as your own.” when training our AI detection model. 

Slight editing with Grammarly or similar is NOT considered AI generated. 

For reference here is what we aim to identify as AI or Original…

* AI Generated and Not Edited =  AI Generated Text
* AI Generated and Human Edited = AI Generated Text
* AI Outline, Human Written and heavily AI Edited = AI Generated Text 
* AI Research and Human Written = Original Human-Generated
* Human Written and Edited with Grammarly = Original Human-Generated
* Human Written and Edited = Original Human-Generated
