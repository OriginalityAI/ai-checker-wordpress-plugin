# Originality.ai AI Checker

The Originality.ai wordpress plugin brings the world’s most accurate AI content detector directly into your WordPress dashboard. Scan all your content – from a single post, to your entire website – for AI content.

Originality.ai is effective on AI text generated using popular large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, GPT-4, Claude, Llama, Gemini and more. It also detects paraphrase plagiarism, which is one of the most popular ways to bypass AI or plagiarism detection.
